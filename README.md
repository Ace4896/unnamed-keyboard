# Unnamed Keyboard

A (work-in-progress) keyboard.

## Useful Resources

This is my first attempt at designing anything keyboard related, and I've been referring to various guides online to come up with these designs. I've listed some of the resources I've used below:

- [Keyboard Layout Editor (KLE)](http://www.keyboard-layout-editor.com/) for designing and exporting the layout
- **PCB Design**
  - [Noah Kiser](https://www.youtube.com/@noahkiser)'s PCB design videos on YouTube
  - [ebastler/marbastlib](https://github.com/ebastler/marbastlib) KiCAD library with various keyboard-related parts and footprints
  - [zykrah/kicad-kle-placer](https://github.com/zykrah/kicad-kle-placer) KiCAD plugin for placing switch footprints based on a KLE
